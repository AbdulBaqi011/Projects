## 1 Introduction

The `Job Offer Comparison App` is a useful and well-developed software system devevloped for the Android Operating System. The software allows users to enter details for different jobs (including their current job) and compare the jobs along relevant attributes and assesment criteria so that the user can choose the best job for them.

## 2 Process Description

The following is a description of the Rational Unified Software Process phases applied to the `Job Offer Comparison App`.

### Business Modeling
The business modeling phase began with the **Assignment 5: Software Design** individual assignment. The Background and Requirements section of the assignment document detailed the business context for the system that solved that need. That document details the desired workflow, goals, and use cases. The **Entrance Criteria** for this phase is the design document itself. The *Exit Criteria* for this phase was also completed with the same document by identifying requirements.

### Requirements
The requirements phase of RUP for this project has to do with documenting functional and non-functional requirements. This was provided as part of the initial assigment document, within the _Requirements_ section. Here, we also begin the informal discussion of the Use Case Model. Therefore, both the **Entrance Criteria** and **Exit Criteria** were met by that document. This provided a basis for further phases.

### Analysis & Design
The analysis and design phase deals with defining software architecture according the identified requirements. The **Entrace Criteria** for this phase are the requirements. This was first done individually, then collaboratively and refined during a brainstorming session. A team UML document that detailed system architecture. The team then completed a User Interface Design, Use Case Modeling Document, and a Component Diagram. These three compose the **Exit Criteria** for this phase of the RUP.

### Implementation
The implementation phase deals with developing, unit testing, and integration testing the system. In essence, this phase converts the Design Documents into working code. Therefore, the **Entrance Criteria** for this phase is the existance of a well designed and understood set of Design Documents. The **Exit Criteria* is the implementation with a suite of tests in Android Studio and merged to main through git.

### Test
The test phase deals with thorough verification of system behavior at the macro level. Here, larger integration tests, regression tests, and manual verification will occur. Therefore, the **Entrance Criteria** is an implementation, and the **Exit Criteria** is the existance of a system failure or completed verification of behavior. If there are faults, the relevant subsystem will re-enter the Implementation phase.

### Deployment
The development phase deals with releasing the system to the stakeholders. In this context, that is a submitted assignment to Gradescope. The **Entrance Criteria** for this phase is the completion of the Test phase. The **Exit Criteria** for this phase is the submitted assignment through Gradescope.
