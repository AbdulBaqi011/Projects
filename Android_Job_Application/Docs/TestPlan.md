\# Test Plan

\*\*Author\*\*: \<Team065\>

\## 1 Testing Strategy

\### 1.1 Overall strategy

- Unit Testing: Each individual method and function in core classes (e.g., JobComparisonApp, Job, ComparisonSettings) will be tested separately using automated unit tests. Frontend / backend developers will be responsible for writing and executing these tests.
- Integration Testing: The interactions between different components (e.g., UI, job entry, and comparison logic) will be validated to ensure seamless communication. This will conducted by frontend / backend developers and Testing Engineers.
- System Testing: End-to-end testing will be performed to verify that all features work together as expected. This will include testing job entry, comparison settings, and ranking algorithms. The testing engineers will handle system testing.
- Regression Testing: After updates or bug fixes, regression tests will be executed to ensure existing functionalities remain intact. Both frontend / backend developers and testing engineers should be involved in the process.

\### 1.2 Test Selection

- Unit Testing: White-box techniques such as statement coverage, branch coverage and path coverage will be used to ensure every function and logic branch is tested.
- Integration Testing: A mix of white-box and black-box testing will be used to verify component interactions.
- System Testing: Black-box testing techniques like partition testing and boundary values will be applied to validate system-wide functionalities without considering internal code structure.
- Regression Testing: Both black-box and white-box techniques will be executed to catch unintended side effects of code changes.


\### 1.3 Adequacy Criterion

- Unit Testing: Coverage criteria will include statement coverage, branch coverage, and path coverage. The goal is to ensure that every function and logic path is exercised during testing.
- Integration Testing: Adequacy will be measured by interaction coverage, ensuring all data flows and component integrations are tested effectively.
- System Testing: Functional coverage will be evaluated based on system requirements, use cases, and expected behaviors to ensure all critical workflows are tested.
- Regression Testing: Adequacy will be determined based on risk-based test case selection, prioritizing high-impact functionalities and previously identified defects.


\### 1.4 Bug Tracking

- Bug Reporting: Testers and developers will log bugs with detailed descriptions, including steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual results, and screenshots where applicable.
- Issue Triage: Bugs and enhancements will be reviewed and prioritized based on severity, impact, and urgency.
- Assignment and Resolution: Issues will be assigned to the relevant developers for resolution. Fixes will be verified through regression testing.
- Status Updates: The tracking system will be updated regularly to reflect issue progress, including statuses such as Open, In Progress, Resolved, and Closed.
- Enhancement Requests: Feature enhancements will be documented, discussed, and reviewed before implementation to ensure they align with project goals.

\### 1.5 Technology

- JUnit: Used for unit testing Java-based components to verify correctness at the method level.
- Selenium: Employed for automated UI testing to validate frontend interactions and behaviors.
